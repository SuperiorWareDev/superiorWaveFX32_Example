# SuperiorWaveFX32 - A Low-Level Voice Engine (VB6, 2004)

## Project Overview

**SuperiorWaveFX32** is a complete, real-time voice communication engine developed in Visual Basic 6 in 2004. This project stands as a testament to early 2000s low-level systems programming, created long before modern high-level audio libraries and frameworks were commonplace.

The engine is built around a custom DLL (`superiorWavefx32.dll`) that provides direct access to the Windows Multimedia API (`winmm.dll`), allowing for intricate control over audio capture, real-time compression, and playback.

**Date Created:** 2004
**Core Technologies:** Visual Basic 6, `winmm.dll` (P/Invoke), DSP Group TrueSpeech Codec

## Historical Context & Significance

This project was single-handedly developed by Johnny Walker at the age of 19. Without the aid of modern AI assistants or the wealth of information available today, this engine was meticulously crafted through dedication and a deep understanding of audio systems, often after long days at a primary job.

The initial inspiration and a key tip to utilize the `winmm.dll` came from a friend, Martin Johnson, which set the stage for this deep dive into Windows system programming.

This repository serves not only as a code sample but as a piece of programming history, demonstrating what was possible with passion and raw skill.

## Key Features

### Custom Audio Engine (`superiorWavefx32.dll`)
The core of the project is a custom-built DLL that abstracts the complexities of the Windows Multimedia API, providing a clean, object-oriented interface for use in VB6.

### Real-time Audio Compression
The engine captures raw 16-bit PCM audio and uses the DSP Group's **TrueSpeech codec** to compress it in real-time, making it suitable for transmission over low-bandwidth connections, a critical feature for applications of that era.

### Advanced Localhost Relay & Packet Filtering
One of the most intricate features of the original implementation was a `localhostrelay` server. This component was designed to manage and filter voice packets, featuring a sophisticated **voice lag buffer overflow** mechanism. This demonstrated a deep understanding of network programming and data management that was far ahead of its time.

## Code Structure

* **`Recorder.cls`**: A class responsible for capturing audio from the microphone, managing the capture stream, and passing the raw audio to the stream converter for compression.
* **`Player.cls`**: A class responsible for receiving compressed audio data, decompressing it back to PCM format, and managing the playback stream to the speakers.
* **`frmMain.frm`**: The main user interface form that hosts the `Recorder` and `Player` components, providing a simple record/stop interface to demonstrate the full-duplex capabilities.

This project is a snapshot of ingenuity and a powerful reminder of the foundational skills that underpin modern software development.
